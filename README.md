# Reinforcement Learning

*Reinforcement Learning is* an interesting branch of *Machine Learning* that lies somewhere outside of *supervised* and *unsupervised learning*.  It tends to deal in sequential environments where an optimal behavior exists, but the connection between outcomes and choices can be distant (*credit assignment problem*).

This repo is simply a playground for my tinkering in this field.  Currently, the repo is structured as:

* demo_notebooks \
    * Jupyter notebook demonstrations
    * One environment - "[CartPole-v1](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/)" from OpenAI
    * Value and Policy based approaches
* diagrams \
    * Neural network diagrams used in various approaches

Eventually, I'd like to:
* Add demonstrations with different environments (since each environment has its own nuances)
* Condense notebooks into scripts
* Introduce more object oriented principles into my implementations
